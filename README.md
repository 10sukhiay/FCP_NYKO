# Simulating the airborne transmission of coronavirus for a network of rooms


### Oscar Bond, Kaelan Melville, Yazad Sukhia, Nathan Wooster



### Description

This code creates a COVID-19 simulation. The code simulates both the transmission of the virus within a room, and the effect of individuals 
travelling between rooms across a network. The simulation is carried on a network level for individual days, 
and at a room level for a number of iterations every day.

### How to run

The script can be used to:

1. Show an amination of the simulation on screen
2. Create a simulation over a number of days
3. Show a plot of the network.

This is all run from the XXXX file. 

The file can be run from the command line thanks to the command line 
interface. This allows parameters to be changes without editing the code. e.g.:

    $ python simulator.py               # run simulation with default settings
    $ python simulator.py --cases=10    # have 10 initial cases
    $ python simulator.py --help        # show all command line options
