Person_Class.py

This script contains the Person Class used in the model simulation.
It is not interacted with directly from the command line as takes
inputs from the 'people_array' that is used to interface with the
command line.

import random
import math

class person(object):

    """Creates individual people which move in specific ways.

    In the class there are numerous functions that define the movement and
    interaction of each person in a room.

    The people are x,y position dots that appear in each room.

    Each person is initialised using the data frame output from the people_array.
    A single person is created from every row when the Person class is called in
    '_simulator.py'. For example a people_array row may look like:

    Example
    =======

    x  |  y  |  node   |  status  |  two_meter  |  gravitating
    -----------------------------------------------------
    2  |  1  |    1    |    0     |      1      |       1

    Here the Person class will then create a person class instance that starts moving from
    position (2,1) in room 1. They will be non-infected. They will follow the 2meter
    social distancing rule and will move towards ('gravitate') and sit (stop) at the table.

    To implement the movement of each person, the Person Class has these key functions:

    1) make_new_step_size(): When each person is initialised it gives them a random step size
                             they take every iteration. This allows them to move. Each iteration
                             a person has 50% chance of changing step size (movement speed). Also,
                             the move() function makes sure the person does not go out of the
                             room boundaries.

    2) move():  This function contains nested functions that are called to allow it to work.
                It also contains the 'if' statements that are run each iteration and dictate
                how each person moves using the functions in the class: They key movements are:

            a)   If specified the person follows a 2meter social distancing rule. This uses functions
                 distance(), direction(), position_compared_to_object(), move_away() and
                 calc_dist_to_other_people(). If the closest person is <2m from them, they will move
                 away from that individual.

            b)   If specified the person moves towards ('gravitates to') the table and stops to 'sit' at
                 the table. The table is a user input to say where it is located and the radius size.
                 The table is designed to simulate the impact of infection if people move to congregate
                 in room. This uses the functions direction(), position_compared_to_object(),
                 move_towards(), inside() and stop(). A person moves towards the designated table area,
                 and once inside the area the person stops moving. Every iteration they then have a 50%
                 chance of leaving the table.

    The Person class outputs the updated positions to the data frame to then input to the Heat_Mapping.py.
